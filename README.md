This is a fork of Butano containing the required modifications to build [Sleep Paradox](https://github.com/chrislewisdev/sleep-paradox), a GBA Jam 2024 entry.

It disables Butano's native sound systems so that our custom sound engine by Nikku4211 can be used.

## Usage

Simply clone this repo to any directory on your system, and then point to it using the `LIBBUTANO` variable when building Sleep Paradox.
